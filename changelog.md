### 0.9.4 2014-04-18 Edward Muller (edward@heroku.com)

* Formalized the Formatter Interface, pretty much only an internal change
### 0.9.3 2014-04-17 Edward Muller (edward@heroku.com)

* -back-buff=50 default, 100 was probably too many
* Simplify LogplexBatchFormatter, adding a few MB/s performance wise.
* Other cleanups

### 0.9.2 2014-04-17 Edward Muller (edward@heroku.com)

* -back-buff=100 default to handle spikes in logs.

### 0.9.1 2014-04-16 Edward Muller (edward@heroku.com)

* Set the user agent to something sane: log-shuttle/0.9.0 (go1.2.1; darwin; amd64; gc)
### 0.9.0 2014-04-16 Edward Muller (edward@heroku.com)

* Large re-write of batching behaviour. Previously logs were written into the
  batch in logplex format. Now incoming data is stored in raw form and
  Formatters, supporting the io.Reader interface, are used to format the batch
  for http.Client's delivery to logplex. This change allowed me to get rid of the
  batch_manager as batches are now much lighter. In testing I've seen an overall
  decerase in RAM and an overall increase in performance as well. This also paves
  the way for other formatters. There is still work to do to abstract outlets a
  bit though, but I'm waiting until I implement delivery in another format to
  worry about that.
* Some changes to the metrics that are emitted. Previously they were all being
  written out as time durations, even when they're not actually.
* reset lastPoll when the socket is polled

### 0.8.1 2014-04-01 Edward Muller (edward@heroku.com)

* Reduce the amount of log-shuttle's in the stats output

### 0.8.0 2014-04-01 Edward Muller (edward@heroku.com)

* Don't reset stats when they are polled via the socket
* Some refactorings

### 0.7.1 2014-03-10 Edward Muller (edward@heroku.com)

* Wrap the batch in a Reader so that we can properly retry delivery.
  Before this we weren't actually delivering retries. :-(

### 0.7.0 2014-02-25 Edward Muller (edward@heroku.com)

* retry EOF errors -max-attempts times (defaults to 3), with a 100ms sleep in between
* Log # of attempts at end
